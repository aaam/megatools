megarc(5)
=========

NAME
----
megarc - Configuration file for megatools


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'~/.megarc'
'./.megarc'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Megatools use INI configuration file to store commonly used login credentials.
This makes it less bothersome to use the tools, as you can simply write

--------
$ megadf
--------

instead of

--------
$ megadf --username my@email.com --password mypass
--------

when using the tools.

Configuration file is read either from the current directory or user's home
directory. Exceptions are when `--ignore-config-file` was passed to the tool, or
when explicit path to the config file was given via `--config <path>`.


CONFIG FILE SECTIONS
--------------------

All sections are optional. All names are case sensitive, thus you must write
[Login], and not [login], and so on.


[Login] Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Username::
	Your username.

Password::
	Your password. Be aware that back slashes have special meaning. If you
	have back slash in your password, you must escape it with another
	backslash. For example: my\nice\password would be written as
	my\\nice\\password in the config file.


[Cache] Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Timeout::
	Cache timeout in seconds (default is 10 minutes).


EXAMPLE
-------

Create ~/.megarc (on linux) or mega.ini file containing these 3 lines:

------------
[Login]
Username = your@email
Password = yourpassword
------------

Run man:megadf[1] to check that megatools are able to login to your account.
