First of all, thanks for this great tool!  I love it!  Everything works perfectly but I have one small problem.

While downloading I use:
$ megacopy --local /home/pi/MEGA --remote /Root/raspberry --download

MEGATOOLS
- All content is live piped into /home/pi/MEGA
- So file starts at 0 bytes, and grows until finished
- Is the file still downloading? Or finished? Or timedout? Or has my box crashed?

OFFICIAL MEGA GUI APP
- Saves first to a tmp file
- After download finished, moves file to /home/pi/MEGA
- If file exists, file is 100% downloaded and ready.

My question:
Is there a way to see what the file-status is?  Or is it possible to use temp file like in the official app?

Thanks again for your great work.
